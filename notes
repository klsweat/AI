What is AI?
  john mccarthy: every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. 
  An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language form abstractions and concepts, solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans, and imporove themselves.
  AI is the use of machines to solve problems that are usually done by us humans.
  it is a machine or computer program that learns how to do tasks that requires a form of intelligence and that are usually done by human. Intelligence comes in many forms and 
  has many differenct aspects.
  
  Original 7 Aspects of A.I. (1955)
    1. Simulting higher functions of the human brain
    2. Programmin a computer to use general language.
    3. Arranging hypothetical neurons n a manner so that they can form conecpts.
    4. A way to determine and measure problem complexity
    5. Self-improvement
    6. Abstractions: Defined as the quality of dealing with ideas rather than events.
    7. Randomness and creativity
    
 Important factors of AI:
  generalization learning   
  reasoning
  problem solving
  perception
  language understanding
  
Most AI Alogrthms are expert systems:
  a system that employs knowledge that ordinarly require human expertise.
  D. mines alphago is not expert system which means its algorithms can be used and applied to other things.
   
  
History of AI
  first coined in 1956, by john mcarthy, called together scientists to see if a machine could learn like a child does using trial and error to develop formal reasoning.
